There were several interesting things that I was required to build for example, I added functionality to the shopping cart page to support applying a voucher code.

There are a lot of things that are hardcoded in this project that I probably would have avoided if the project had a larger scope. For example, all of the movie and session information is hardcoded where it would have been more ideal to consume the information from a service that provides up to date movie data. 

I have plans to tackle this project again using Angular JS.
